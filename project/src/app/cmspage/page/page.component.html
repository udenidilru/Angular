                <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers.
                        Many students define paragraphs in terms of length:
                         a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences,
                          a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though,
                           the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what
                            constitutes a paragraph.</p>
